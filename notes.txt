R1: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11


R2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12


h : 0, 3, 5, -3, -5

entropy = disorder

when R1 low, if further h gets from 0, the less entropy you get
R1 low, R2 high, creates striping, h distorts striping at 5
R1 and R2 1 away, causes large patterns
as R2 is high, h does less
R1 high, creates less interesting patterns
R1 low, higher entropy

entropy spikes at R1 and at R2
	mutual info dips at these points
	
corolation peaks at boundary between R1 and R2 and R2 and rest of map 
corrolation moves up and down with h
